  <h1>About Boxel</h1>

  <p>
  The Boxel Design System is our way of generating sophisticated user interfaces that will hook directly
  into Cardstackâ€™s full-stack runtime. They can be composed without a significant amount of programming,
  as it is our ultimate goal to make the entire UI assembly process no-code.

    This screen will be updated to contain a detailed explanation of Boxel, including answering the
      question: <em>"Why yet another design system?"</em> and waxing poetic on <em>"What is the underlying
      philosophy and research behind the Boxel system?"</em> It will be illustrated by working demos of
      Boxel in action.
